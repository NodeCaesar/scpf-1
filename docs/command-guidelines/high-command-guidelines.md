# High Command Guidelines
## Introduction
Hey there! Thank you for coming to check or re-check the Foundation High Command Handbook. If you're new to the Foundation's High Command team, then welcome! If you need any assistance, please don't hesitate to contact another member of the Foundation's command team - they'd be happy to help you out. Throughout this article, you'll find information pertaining to the Foundation High Command team. **Information this article contains also applies to those who are within a higher command team unless stated otherwise.**

It is important to note that this is not all the information you are required to know. It is advised you visit each knowledge base article to see if any associated information they contain now applies to you.

## Requirements
Being part of the Foundation High Command team shows you are a major figure for the Foundation. You also take on board many new responsibilities. Due to this, there are a few requirements personnel must meet before being granted a position inside the Foundation's High Command team to ensure they are capable of the standards that are expected. Members must meet the following.

- Refresh their mind with the Foundation [Medium Command Handbook](/command-guidelines/medium-command-guidelines.html).
    - The Foundation Medium Command requirements also apply for Foundation High Command entry.
- Hold a clearance of Level 3 for entry.

## Upon Entry
Becoming a member of the Foundation High Command team can be a little daunting at first, but this feeling will be overcome quite fast as experience is gathered. Your department Overseer will be guiding you at first, so there's no need to worry! When you enter the Foundation High Command team, there are a few tasks you must do to get you on track.

- Read recent messages inside the "#hr_notices" channel within the main Discord server so you're aware of what has been happening within the past few weeks.
- Contact your department Overseer to be added to the appropriate Google groups, which will grant you access to some Google Shared Drives accordingly.
- Contact the Department of External Affairs Overseer to be invited to their Discord server to be informed/handle raids, riots and any other relevant events.

## Leading Departments
*As a reminder, the "Leading Departments" section of the [Medium Command Handbook](/command-guidelines/medium-command-guidelines.html) applies here as a baseline.*

### Discord Server Ownership
All Discord servers related to the Foundation must be owned by The Administrator or another account based on their request. This is to ensure the ownership of all servers remains coherent and their integrity is less likely to be damaged.

### Quotas
No quotas are to be imposed on any member(s) of the Foundation unless authorised via a Council majority vote (and, within these cases, they must be minimal). We follow this principle as quotas bring stress on members, and as a result, cause demotivation. The only time quotas are to be used is in a situation where they are absolutely required, such as for a department to function effectively until a solution is implemented.

### Duties
Duties must not be created just to give members something to do. It must either enhance their gameplay experience or aid in the operations of a department or the Foundation. A worthless task or duty is not fun, and as such, should not be implemented.

## Department Reports
To ensure the Site Director and the O5 Council is kept informed of how the department you're assigned to is performing, it is important that on the 1st and 15th day of each month, you send the Site Director a department report. Such a report will allow for a concrete discussion (if needed) to take place regarding anything which needs to be adjusted within the department and guide you with your plans.

The department report must follow a template. This template can be found within the "FOUNDATION - Medium Command \| Public" Google Shared Drive.

## Universal Announcements & Notices
The #announcements and #notices channels are open to a set of High Command personnel to allow for noticeable content to be posted. For example, a recent Security Department guideline change allowing them to guard other Foundation personnel.

There are no strict content-boundaries when it comes to posting - as long as the content applies to members outside the individual department, all is well.

### Announcements
The purpose of the #announcements channel is to post large-scale or critical information that impacts the Foundation as a whole.

In order to ensure there isn't a large flood of pinging, the following permissions are enforced.

- **Post**
    - A (Technical) Site Director and above requires no approval.
- **Post with @here**
    - The Site Director requires approval from the O5 Council.
    - The Technical Site Director and above require no approval.
- **Post with @everyone**
    - The Technical Site Director requires approval from the O5 Council.
    - The O5 Council requires no approval.

### Notices
The purpose of #notices is to post general information that is mostly universal but isn't critical and may not be actively looked upon by everyone.

In order to ensure there isn't a large flood of pinging, the following permissions are enforced.

- **Post**
    - Level 4 and above require no approval.
- **Post with @here**
    - A (Technical) Site Director and above requires no approval.
- **Post with @everyone**
    - The Site Director requires approval from the O5 Council.
    - The Technical Site Director and above require no approval.

## In-Game Moderation
*Commands listed within this section are executable within the main Discord server.*

For each action issued, evidence has to be supplied. Evidence must be uploaded to an image sharing site, such as Gyazo, where the evidence URL will not break or disappear.

### Bans
In order to ban a player, see the below examples.

- **-ban Wumpus https://coolimagesite.com Exploiting** - Bans the user “Wumpus” forever, with the evidence being “https://coolimagesite.com”, with the reason “Exploiting”.
- **-ban Wumpus https://coolimagesite.com days:3 Glitching** - Bans the user “Wumpus” for 3 days, with the evidence being “https://coolimagesite.com”, with the reason “Glitching”.

If an accidental ban is made, please contact a Site Director or above so they can reverse the action. This can be processed by them via executing the below command, as an example.

- -unban Wumpus Accidental ban - Unbans the user “Wumpus” for the reason “Accidental ban”.

### Warnings
Warnings should be added to players if deemed necessary, such as committing their first minor offence. Please note that you must inform players that you are warning them and why - this process is not automated.

This system is used as it allows members of a judicial position to take a more in-depth look at a player's history.

To issue a warning, use the below command as an example.

- **-warn Wumpus https://coolimagesite.com Attempting to glitch** - Warns the user “Wumpus”, with the evidence being “https://coolimagesite.com”, with the reason “Attempting to glitch”.

### Notes
Notes should be added to players when something associated with them may need to be referred to at a future date. For example, being involved in an incident that included multiple other players.

In order to create a note, use the below command as an example.

- **-note add Wumpus Possible alternative account of ‘JohnDoe’** - Adds a note to the user “Wumpus”, with the content being “Possible alternative account of ‘JohnDoe’”.

### Lookup
Sometimes, the history of a player is required, such as when they submit an appeal or are applying for a position.

In order to look up the history of a player, use the below command as an example.

- **-info Wumpus** - Displays data about the Roblox user “Wumpus”.
- **-info @Wumpus#0001** - Displays data about the Discord user “Wumpus#0001”.

## Discord Moderation
In the event a user is in violation of a rule, a Level 4 or above is required to take unbiased action. Action is taken via the Discord bot "Dyno" in order to maintain a set of moderation history per Discord user. See the below commands on how to moderate users.

- In order to warn a user, use the "?warn <mention> <reason>" command.
- In order to kick a user, use the "?kick <mention> <reason>" command.
- In order to ban a user...
    - temporarily, use the command "?ban <mention> <<hours>h | <days>d>> <reason>" command. 
    - permenently, use the "?ban <mention> <reason>" command.
- In order to view a user's moderation history, use the "?modlogs <user snowflake>" command.

**All moderation must contain an image link as evidence of the offence within the specified reasoning via an image sharing platform (such as Gyazo).**

Before issuing a moderation action, it is important to inspect their moderation history and act accordingly in line with the outlined moderation flow in this article. Also, check to ensure the user is not on their final warning, as if they are, they are to be issued a ban.

### Multiple Infractions
When a user commits more than one rule infraction before action is taken, the outcome of said infraction will vary as detailed below.

- In cases where the associated actions are of the same type e.g. a 1-day ban and a 3-day ban, they are to be stacked. In this scenario, it would form a 4-day ban.
- In cases where the associated actions are of different types e.g. a 10-minute mute and a 1-day ban, the strictest punishment shall take precedence. In this scenario, it would be a 1-day ban.

When an action is submitted, all infractions must be stated within the reasoning provided.

### Final Chances
When moderating a user, you need to evaluate if this should be their final warning before progressing to a ban. For example, if a user has been kicked for spamming, you need to indicate in your moderation reasoning that their next offence will lead to a ban. This is in accordance with the moderation flow outlined in this article. This informs the next moderator, in the event another offence has been committed, that the user now needs to be banned and not be given any more chances.

## Nolt Moderation
As part of the High Command team, it is essential that you vote, comment and state progress and thoughts you may have in relation to suggestions, especially during the implementation phase. This is to ensure the community is aware of what the command team's feelings are, and how progress is getting along.

The platform we use for suggestions is called "Nolt", which is typically what the Foundation's command team refers to it as.

On Nolt, Level 4 gain moderation privileges, which grants rights to manage suggestions. This ensures the content on the platform remains organised and respectful.

### Suggestions
- **Merge** - Merges the currently selected suggestion into another. This is useful in scenarios where there are duplicate suggestions, but don't want existing votes to be dismissed.
- **Lock** - Disables comments on the suggestion. This is useful in scenarios where there is a theme of disrespect within the suggestion's comments which isn't stopping after a warning.
- **Delete** - Deletes the suggestion, also removing its associated data and content. Only to be used where a suggestion's content is against the community rules.

### Comments
- **Delete** - Deletes the comment. Only to be used when a comment's content is in violation of the community rules.

## Department Disciplinaries
When issuing a disciplinary in the department you are a command member for, it is important to also log it via Eve in the form of a note. This allows members of a judicial position to look at all information in regards to a member, including their departments, in one central location.

When adding a department disciplinary to a user's Eve notes, ensure it follows the below format.

```
<Full Department Name> - <Punishment> - <Violation>
```

An example of the above format would be:

```
Security Department - Demotion from Security Sentinel to Security Junior - Disobeying orders
```

## Raids
Raids must be discussed in advance with a member of the hostile team's leadership. Alternatively, they may decide to contact you directly or tag you within the Department of External Affairs Discord server. If deemed appropriate, in accordance with the [Raid Guidelines](/gameplay/raiding.html), you are to authorise the raid using the `-raid authorise <ci/thi>` command within the "#bot_commands" channel of the main Discord server. When the raid time has expired, similarly, unauthorise the raid using the `-raid unauthorise` command within the same channel.

## Riots
Riots must be discussed in advance with a member of the rioting team's leadership. Alternatively, they may decide to contact you directly or tag you within the Department of External Affairs Discord server. If deemed appropriate, in accordance with the [Riot Guidelines](/gameplay/rioting.html), you are to authorise the riot using the `-riot authorise` command within the "#bot_commands" channel of the main Discord server. When the riot time has expired, similarly, unauthorise the riot using the `-riot unauthorise` command within the same channel.
