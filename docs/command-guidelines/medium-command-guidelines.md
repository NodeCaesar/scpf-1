# Medium Command Guidelines
## Introduction
Hey there! Thank you for coming to check or re-check the Foundation Medium Command Handbook. If you're new to the Foundation's Medium Command team, then welcome! If you need any assistance, please don't hesitate to contact another member of the Foundation's command team - they'd be happy to help you out. Throughout this article, you'll find information pertaining to the Foundation Medium Command team. **Information this article contains also applies to those who are within a higher command team unless stated otherwise.**

It is important to note that this is not all the information you are required to know. It is advised you visit each knowledge base article to see if any associated information they contain now applies to you.

## Requirements
Being part of the Foundation Medium Command team shows you are a major figure for the Foundation. You also take on board many new responsibilities. Due to this, there are a few requirements personnel must meet before being granted a position inside the Foundation's Medium Command team to ensure they are capable of the standards that are expected. Members must:

- Hold a clearance of Level 2 for entry.
- Have a Discord account.
- Be active on a daily-basis on Discord and in-game, actively contributing to the community.
- Have a clean punishment record (very minor offenses do not count).
- Have a dedicated attitude and show readiness to take on new responsibilities.
- Be able to represent the Foundation in a positive and uplifting manner.
- Have a decent understanding of the English language, or at least show a strong desire.

## Upon Entry
Becoming a member of the Foundation Medium Command team can be a little daunting at first, but you'll get over this feeling quite fast as you learn. Your department Level 4 will be guiding you at first, so there's no need to worry! When you enter the Foundation Medium Command team, there are a few tasks you must do to get you on track.

- Read recent messages inside the "#mr_notices" channel within the main Discord server so you're aware of what has been happening within the past few weeks.
- Contact your department Overseer to be added to the appropriate Google groups, which will grant you access to some Google Shared Drives accordingly.

## Leading Departments
As part of your department command team, you are responsible for leading your department. As a result, it is essential you adhere to the following principles.

- Actively communicate with your department members.
- Provide department members with an insight as to whatâ€™s going on.
- Work with members to address any concerns and queries they may have.
- Involve department members as much as possible. The more perspectives, the better.
- Work in cooperation with your department's Level 4. The knowledge you have in regards to the department will be drawn upon in order to further the department.
- Utilise your skills and knowledge effectively in the appropriate areas, but at the same time, try boosting your weaknesses.

## Maturity & Grammar
While speaking formally in a manner that is grammatically correct is preferable, Foundation Command members may speak in an informal/casual way to others in informal channels or when a formal conversation isn't being held.

Within formal channels or when a formal conversation is being held, formal communication and grammar are required.

Maturity is required to uphold professionalism.

## Test Subject Containment Area Privileges
Foundation Command has access to enter the Test Subject Containment area to interact with Class D personnel and answer any queries they may have. It is allowed to go past the safety line, as long as you are heading to sit at a table.

The following requirements must be met in order to use these privileges.

- Must have at least one Security Department Sentinel+ to escort.
- If any riot occurs, you must leave the Test Subject Containment area immediately.
- Formal and grammatically correct communication is required.

## Containment Zone Privileges
Foundation Command does not require permission to access containment zones, although should follow the advice from Mobile Task Force personnel in case there is an on-going threat taking place. One escort from the Mobile Task Forces is required to enter containment zones.

The area that constitutes a "containment zone" is the field beyond the associated checkpoints (scanners).

## Meetings & Conferences
### Departments
Department command teams must host department meetings and/or conferences on a regular basis, usually bi-weekly. As many members should attend as feasible. The following must be discussed at a minimum.

- Recent notices and announcements.
- Recent changes.
- The gathering of feedback.
- The answering of concerns and questions.

A notice must be posted at least 24 hours prior to the meeting/conference taking place and is best to be hosted between 6 pm and 9 pm UTC+0. It must take place at the Conference Centre.

### Foundation Command
Every two weeks, the Site Director holds a Foundation Command meeting. A notice is posted prior to this event taking place. It is essential you attend unless your time availability doesn't permit it. For more information in relation to Foundation Command meetings, please visit here and view the [Overwatch Command](/positions-and-ranking-up/chain-of-command/overwatch-command.html) article.

## Inactivity Notices
Inactivity notices are managed by Foundation Level 3 and above unless department guidelines state otherwise.

In order to manage inactivity notices, visit the "Inactivity Tracker" sheet inside of the "FOUNDATION - Medium Command \| Public" Google Shared Drive. At the bottom, there is a sheet for each department. You are only to manage inactivity notices for the department(s) where you are a command member.

For each inactivity notice submission, it must be processed by yourself. This is relatively simple. Each row is one submitted inactivity notice. Fields are categorised to make management easier.

- Submissions - The submitted data for the inactivity notice.
- Calculations - Automatic calculations providing extra insight into the inactivity notice e.g. if the inactivity notice has expired.
- Management - Editable fields where data must be inputted yourself. The fields in this category are self-explanatory.

When an inactivity notice has been processed by yourself, ensure to contact the member via Discord to inform them of the outcome of their submitted inactivity notice.
