# Disciplinary Hearings
A Disciplinary Hearing is a process in which a community member may attend a hearing in relation to an action that has been taken towards them. In such sessions, it provides the chance for the member in question to state their case to a set of jurors as to why said action should be reversed or modified. The process is intended to provide fair treatment and independent review.

## Proceedings of Hearings
All participating parties will be invited/added to a Discord channel in which the session will commence. During the session, a discussion will be held explaining why the issued action was taken. The requester will have the opportunity to debunk the issued action.

When the above stated discussion comes to a conclusion, the content of the channel will be reviewed by the relevant parties (usually the Ethics Committee High Command and/or the O5 Council, although can be other parties if necessary) and a conclusion will be reached. 
The verdict will be conveyed to the requester within 48 hours with reasoning as to why this conclusion was reached.

## Eligibility of Hearings
Though uncommon, there are cases where a hearing cannot be granted. The following reasons can be provided for a request to hearing to be denied:

- The member has requested a hearing too recently (cooldown of 31 days).
- The member has no desire to professionally work in cooperation with members part of the Disciplinary Hearing (this takes into account previous sessions too).
- There are too many Disciplinary Hearings scheduled, and therefore a session cannot be granted within a reasonable timeframe.
- The action taken in question is not eligible for a Disciplinary Hearing (see section below).

In addition to this, the following actions are **not** eligible for a Hearing:

- Foundation-wide blacklists are not eligible as they are issued in extraordinary circumstances. Only the O5 Council has the right to accept a blacklist appeal via **support@scpf.team**.
- Roblox and Discord bans are not eligible an appeal for such actions must be made via e-mailing **support@scpf.team**.
- Temporary actions (e.g. limited Discord mutes, limited in-game bans) are not eligible as they will have very likely expired before the Disciplinary Hearing takes place. These too should be sent to the support address.

## Attendance of Hearings
During your hearing, there will be at least one Ethics Committee member and one Intelligence Agency member present, these must be of somewhat senior ranks.
If the offence committed is considered severe enough, these members will always include the Committee and Agency's department heads.
Additionally, as requester one may optionally invite another member of their choice to serve as their defence, although this person does not need to be present in order for the session to commence due to time constraints.

The following users may be present at any given case, although may only interact with the session when called upon or circumstances require so.

- The Administrator
- O5 Council
- Site Director
- The Editor
- The Special Agent in Charge

If the session requester desires so, they may request for members to be closed off from the session - in such cases however, valid justification must be provided e.g. privacy. The Overseeing Foreperson may not be closed off from the session unless The Administrator or the O5 Council remains present.

## Formalities of Hearings
Disciplinary Hearings are an opportunity for an action to be reversed or modified. It is not an inherent right.
As a result, the following formalities are expected in the organisation and operation of sessions. They apply to all participating members.

- Professionalism
- Cooperation
- Respect
- Impartiality

Upon breaking of any of the aforementioned formalities, the session will be terminated, and potentially rescheduled depending on the offending participant and severity.
